Scene Loader
============

This project is a continuation of [Model Loader](https://github.com/Cabrra/Model-Loader) which extends the functionality to open and read a scene (.scn) file with a list of mesh (.mesh) file names and positions (i.e. matrix data). It stores the previous defined data in an STL map object. Once the data has been loaded, it renders all the meshes in the same way as in the Model Loader project.
